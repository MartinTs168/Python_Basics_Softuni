for number in range(1, 101):  # we begin from one and 101 is the goal + 1 because behind it is like in C# i < 101 last print is 100
    print(number)
for number in range(1, 10, 2):  # 2 is by how many points we raise the number example in C# : for (int number; number < 10; number + 2)
    print(number)
